# FLACblaster

FLACblaster is a file-based music manager and music player.

It is the spiritual successor to [SicMu Neo](https://github.com/mira-x/sicmu) and [mp3blaster](https://mp3blaster.sourceforge.net/), but with a modern kotlin backend, built afresh. Currently, it is barely working, but is being actively developed.
